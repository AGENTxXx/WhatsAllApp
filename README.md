Chrome Extension that creates a UI overlay for WhatsApp Web to enumerate phone numbers, profile pics and about texts

This is a Proof of Concept packed in a Chrome Extension. It's not bug free and you may run into errors. If there was a stage before alpha it would be in that stage. Use it wisely!

Do you like WhatsAllApp and do you want to give me a little support? Even a small donation like $2 for a cup of coffee â˜•  helps me a lot! :)

## New functionality
### Show 'last seen time' for some accounts
Chat session accounts now show the 'last seen time'. Chat session accounts are accounts that had an active chat session with you before. Those sessions could have been 1-on-1 or group sessions.

### Download to zip-file
You can now download the numbers + their corresponding profile pictures and statuses to a zip-file. The file contains the profile pictures in jpeg format and a csv-file with numbers and statuses. Give it a try, it seems to be still a little buggy.

### Show only active accounts
I've implemented a checkbox to disable displaying inactive or non-existing accounts.

### Enter custom numbers
You can now enter a comma separated list of numbers to iterate over instead of a hard range.

## Warning
This extension has the permission to read from your WhatsApp Web screen. As you can see in the source code, that permission is not used in a bad way. But, take care if you download this extension from anywhere else but this repo!

## Installation
1. Click 'clone or download' and choose to download the ZIP file
2. Extract the folder from the ZIP file
3. Open up chrome://extensions/
4. Enable developer mode at the top of the screen by clicking the checkbox
5. Click 'load unpacked extension'
6. Select the folder from step 2
7. The extension should appear at the top of the list

## Usage
1. Go to WhatsApp Web, a green button should appear, click it to open the UI
2. Enter a range of phonenumbers you want to enumerate, more than 500 numbers is probably a little much
3. After a few seconds you'll see a table of phonenumbers, profile pics, about texts

## FAQ
* __How about rate limiting?__

   There is some kind of rate limiting in place but what exactly the limits are and their penalties for exceeding them, I don't know yet. Sometimes I get a '427 Too many requests' but a few minutes later I can continue using the API calls.

* __Why is this extension not available in the Chrome Web Store?__

   Because it's a PoC and because I'll have to pay $5. Since I'm Dutch I don't want to pay unless I have absolutely no other choice. So there you go :)

* __Will there be supported pro version?__

  Development of a pro version is in the works. If there is enough commercial support I will release it at some point.
